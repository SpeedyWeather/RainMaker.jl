# New to Julia?

The following lists some useful links if you are new to Julia and
want to use RainMaker.jl and SpeedyWeather.jl for education or research.

## Install Julia

First of all you have to install Julia, the recommended way is using
the installation manager for Julia called [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), see here

- [Install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

## Julia kernel for Jupyter notebooks

Then you may want to use Julia inside [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
(the "Ju" in "Jupyter" is for Julia!)
for this you need to install [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)
which you can do through Julia's built-in package manager [Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/),
this is as easy as

```julia
julia> ] add IJulia
```

where `]` opens the package manger. After this installing a Julia kernel for Jupyter is just

```julia
julia> using IJulia
julia> installkernel("Julia")
```

and you can choose "Julia" as a kernel in a Jupyter notebook.

## SpeedyWeather documentation

Because RainMaker.jl is built on top of [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl)
do have a look at the documentation therein which explains how to run and modify
SpeedyWeather.
