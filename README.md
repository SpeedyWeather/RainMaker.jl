A repository for the atmospheric general circulation model
[SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl)
to analyse and document precipitation at a given location.
In particular, this repository contains functions and a documentation
to show off and rank model setups that make it rain as much
as possible at a certain location (e.g. UK) within a certain period.
New model setups can be submitted and are automatically evaluated
and ranked in the documentation to create a leader board
for the most successful *rainmaker*.

## Analysing precipitation

```julia
using SpeedyWeather, RainMaker

# create a model
spectral_grid = SpectralGrid(trunc=31, nlayers=8)
model = PrimitiveWetModel(;spectral_grid)

# add the rain gauge as callback
rain_gauge = RainGauge(spectral_grid, lond=-1.25, latd=51.75)
add!(model, rain_gauge)

# run the simulation
simulation = initialize!(model)
run!(simulation, period=Day(30))

# visualise 
RainMaker.plot(rain_gauge)
```

## Submitting to the RainMaker challenge
